# BlockGame
Simple pygame-based video game, inspired by NetNinja's Tetris clone.

The goal of block game is to complete rows/columns along an 8x8 grid. The game will generate three shapes at a time, which the user places down on the 8x8 grid. With every new set of 3 shapes, there is atleast one guaranteed orientation that allows them to be placed in the 8x8 grid. When a row or column is completed, the player points. Players can build combos (which give more points per row/column) if they complete a consecutive row/column within 3 moves.
